### you will need to define/store these variables:
### ANCHORECTL_URL
### ANCHORECTL_USERNAME
### ANCHORECTL_PASSWORD
### 
### see anchorectl docs for more info 
### https://docs.anchore.com/current/docs/using/anchorectl_usage/
### https://docs.anchore.com/current/docs/deployment/anchorectl/
###
### also if you want to break on policy violations, then set 
### ANCHORE_FAIL_ON_POLICY=true
### (there is a commented-out line in the test stage where you can
###  set this, or you could add it as a project variable)

stages:
  - "build"
  - "test"

steps:

  prep:
    title: "Prepare Environment"
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      # cf_export is codefresh-specific to export variables across steps
      - export ANCHORE_REGISTRY="docker.io"
      - export ANCHORE_REPO=${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}
      - export ANCHORE_IMAGE_REPO=${ANCHORE_REGISTRY}/${ANCHORE_REPO}
      - export ANCHORE_IMAGE_TAG=cf-${{CF_BRANCH}}
      - cf_export ANCHORE_REGISTRY ANCHORE_REPO ANCHORE_IMAGE_REPO ANCHORE_IMAGE_TAG 
    stage: "build"

  clone:
    title: "Cloning Repository"
    type: "git-clone"
    repo: "${{ANCHORE_REPO}}"
    revision: "${{CF_BRANCH}}"
    git: "github"
    stage: "build"

  build:
    title: "Building Docker Image"
    type: "build"
    ### disable caches to make sure we get a clean build
    no_cache: true
    no_cf_cache: true
    ### codefresh's build step is weird, it absolutely assumes you are using 
    ### docker hub and adds "docker.io" to your image name even if you already
    ### included it, so I am using ANCHORE_REPO here 
    ### instead of ANCHORE_IMAGE_REPO
    ### I kind of think it would make more sense to just use a freestyle
    ### step here and just issue a "docker build" and "docker push" etc
    image_name: "${{ANCHORE_REPO}}"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "${{ANCHORE_IMAGE_TAG}}"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    stage: "build"

  test:
    title: "Scan with Anchore Enterprise"
    image: alpine:latest
    environment:
      - ANCHORE_IMAGE=${{ANCHORE_IMAGE_REPO}}:${{ANCHORE_IMAGE_TAG}}
      ### uncomment the following line if you want to break the pipeline for policy violation (or set it as a project variable, whatever)
      #- ANCHORE_FAIL_ON_POLICY=true
    commands:
      # install latest anchorectl binary
      - apk add --no-cache curl
      - curl -sSfL https://anchorectl-releases.anchore.io/anchorectl/install.sh | sh -s -- -b ${HOME}/.local/bin
      - export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin/:${PATH}"
      - anchorectl -vv system status
      ### add image to queue for scanning
      # you don't have to pass the dockerfile, but if you do, --force is recommended
      # highly recomment --no-auto-subscribe to prevent repetitive polling of the tag
      # if you want to check vulns or gate on policy, --wait is required
      - anchorectl image add --no-auto-subscribe --wait --from registry ${ANCHORE_IMAGE}
      ### get raw vulnerability matches (no judgements)
      - anchorectl image vulnerabilities ${ANCHORE_IMAGE}
      ### we'll check the evaluation and get the callouts either way,
      ### only break the pipeline if ANCHORE_FAIL_ON_POLICY=true
